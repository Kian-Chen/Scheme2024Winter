#   OpenCV

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision) is an open-source library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision. It provides a wide range of tools for image processing, video capture and analysis, 3D reconstruction, object detection, and many other applications.

OpenCV is written in C/C++ and has bindings for Python, Java, and MATLAB. It is cross-platform and can run on Linux, Windows, and macOS.

OpenCV is widely used in academic and industrial research, including in fields such as computer vision, image processing, robotics, and artificial intelligence. It is also used in mobile and embedded devices, including in self-driving cars, drones, and security systems.

The OpenCV library is free to use and open-source, and it is available under an open-source license.
