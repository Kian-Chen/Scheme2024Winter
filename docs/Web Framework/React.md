#   React

React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is used for building complex and interactive web applications. React is a declarative, component-based library that simplifies the process of building user interfaces. It is easy to learn and use, and it has a large and active community of developers.

## Getting Started

To get started with React, you can follow the steps below:

1. Install Node.js and npm on your system.
2. Create a new React project using the create-react-app command.
3. Start the development server using the npm start command.
4. Open the project in your preferred code editor.

## React Components

React components are the building blocks of React applications. They are small, reusable pieces of code that can be used to create complex user interfaces. React components can be created using JavaScript or JSX. JSX is a syntax extension of JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within JavaScript.

## React Props

React props are the input data that are passed to a component. They are used to customize the behavior and appearance of a component. Props can be passed to a component using attributes or properties.

## React State

React state is the data that is managed by a component. It is used to keep track of the user interface state and is updated by the component. State can be updated using the setState method.

## React Life Cycle Methods

React life cycle methods are functions that are called at different stages of the component lifecycle. They are used to perform certain actions when a component is mounted, updated, or unmounted.

## React Router

React Router is a library for handling client-side routing in React applications. It allows you to create dynamic and responsive web applications with ease. It provides a simple and declarative API for handling navigation in your application.
