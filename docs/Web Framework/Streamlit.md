#    Streamlit

Streamlit is an open-source Python library that makes it easy to create and share beautiful, custom web apps for machine learning and data science. In this section, we will learn how to use Streamlit to create a simple web app that displays a list of movies and their ratings.

## Prerequisites

1. Python 3.6 or later
2. Streamlit library

## Step 1: Install Streamlit

To install Streamlit, run the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install streamlit
```

## Step 2: Create a new Streamlit app

To create a new Streamlit app, run the following command in your terminal:

```

This will create a new directory called `my_first_app` with a sample app. Open the `app.py` file in your text editor to see the code.

## Step 3: Add a list of movies and their ratings

To add a list of movies and their ratings, replace the code in `app.py` with the following:

```python
import streamlit as st

# Create a list of movies and their ratings
