#   GUN Make

## 1. Introduction

GUN Make is a tool for automating the build process of software projects. It is a command-line tool that can be used to build, test, and package software projects. GUN Make is a cross-platform tool that can be used on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

## 2. Installation

GUN Make can be installed on Windows, Linux, and macOS using the following steps:

1. Download the latest release of GUN Make from the official website: https://www.github.com/amake/gunmake

2. Extract the downloaded file and move the `gunmake` executable to a directory that is in the system PATH.

3. Verify that GUN Make is installed by running the `gunmake` command in the terminal or command prompt.

## 3. Usage

GUN Make can be used to build, test, and package software projects by running the `gunmake` command in the terminal or command prompt. The `gunmake` command takes a command as an argument, which can be one of the following:

- `build`: builds the software project.
- `test`: runs the test suite of the software project.
- `package`: packages the software project for distribution.

For example, to build a software project, run the following command:

```
gunmake build
```

To run the test suite of a software project, run the following command:

```
gunmake test
```

To package a software project for distribution, run the following command:

```
gunmake package
```

## 4. Configuration

GUN Make can be configured by creating a `Makefile.yaml` file in the root directory of the software project. The `Makefile.yaml` file contains the configuration for GUN Make, such as the build commands, test commands, and package commands.

Here is an example `Makefile.yaml` file:

```yaml
build:
  command: "python setup.py build"

test:
  command: "python setup.py test"

package:
  command: "python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel"
```

In this example, the `build` command is set to `python setup.py build`, which builds the software project using the `setup.py` file. The `test` command is set to `python setup.py test`, which runs the test suite of the software project using the `setup.py` file. The `package` command is set to `python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel`, which packages the software project for distribution using the `setup.py` file.

## 5. Conclusion

GUN Make is a powerful tool for automating the build process of software projects. It can be used to build, test, and package software projects on Windows, Linux, and macOS. The `Makefile.yaml` file can be used to configure GUN Make to build, test, and package software projects according to the needs of the project.
