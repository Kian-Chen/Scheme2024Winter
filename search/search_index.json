For example, to set a breakpoint at line 10 of your program, you can type:</p> <pre><code>break 10\n</code></pre> <p>You can then run the program using the <code>run</code> command:</p> <pre><code>run\n</code></pre> <p>This will start the program and stop at the breakpoint. You can then use GDB commands to analyze the program state and debug the program.</p> <p>For example, you can use the <code>print</code> command to print the value of a variable:</p> <pre><code>print myVariable\n</code></pre> <p>You can also use the <code>step</code> command to execute the next line of code:</p> <pre><code>step\n</code></pre> <p>This will execute the next line of code and stop at the next breakpoint.
